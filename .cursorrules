Task

At Hydrosat we use Dagster on a k8s cluster to execute a broad variety of data processing
and machine learning jobs. This assignment is to create a simplified version of our setup.
In particular, we would like you to deploy Dagster to a k8s cluster and materialize at least
one Dagster “asset”. The asset(s) shall replicate a simplified version of assets we are
dealing with at Hydrosat. It shall have daily partitions, where each partition depends on
the partition of the preceding day. Further, it shall read asset inputs from and write asset
outputs to a configurable S3 bucket (or an equivalent of the latter).
The asset logic should account for the following aspects:
• Asset inputs
o A square/rectangular bounding box, which acts as the processing extent
for any geospatial operation
o Multiple “fields”, represented as polygons, which intersect with the
bounding box and have different planting dates

• Processing
o The asset should download or simulate any data of choice and process it
within the extent of the bounding box. It shall provide some output values
obtained on the field extent for each of the fields, starting at the field’s
planting date.
• Asset output
o The asset output should be one or multiple files containing the output
values per field per daily partition

Notes:
o You can use any k8s deployment you like
o Using any IaC tool is considered a plus. At Hydrosat, we use Terraform.
o You can use AI tools. Please disclose which AI tools you used.
o You are expected to spend no more than 8 hours on the assignment
o The end result should be a public git repository, that would allow us to reproduce
the cluster setup and asset materialization.
